      <p>Very cool pancakes</p>
      <p class="text-box">
        This recipe is an extract from a manga chapter where the characters attempt to cook pancakes. <br><br>
        Pancakes are a simple yet fulfilling dish for beginners, myself included. 
        The product of this recipe should probably be fluffly cloud bread disks so if yours aren't, 
        I have no advise for you because I have never tried this recipe before :/ <br><br>
        My reason for choosing this recipe is this website being a sort of love letter to the orignal manga.
        I look forward to the day I will try this recipe and enjoy the process and pancakes as much as I enjoyed reading the manga itself :D
